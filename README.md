# BillBook
To record my daily expenses.
Tonight, I want to calculate how much money I spend this month.
In the daily life, I usually use Alipay or Wechat Pay, sometime Apply Pay to pay money, I seldom pay in cash.
So I try to write down my payment records in papers, but there are too many records.
Then I use Excel to notes them, and calculate them.
It cost me a lot of time, So I want to build a project to record my daily expenses.
I call it "BiilBook".
I Hope I can finish it before the end of the May Holiday.
I need a few days to make a structure of this project.
I know it's a easy project.
Actually, I want to finish this small project to help learn Git and how to GitHub to manage my project.
Just start it!
In the end, I'm sorry for my broken English.
